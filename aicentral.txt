üîê Abstract Title:
AI Ethics Central: Engineering Responsible AI from Concept to Production

AI Ethics Central is JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs unified platform for embedding security, ethics, and compliance into every phase of AI development. Purpose-built to integrate with the CDAO go/fusion portal, it empowers developers to shift left‚Äîaddressing risks not just at runtime or deployment, but during design, data preparation, and training.

While existing controls like file scanning, red teaming, SIT, and runtime protection kick in after a model is built, AI Ethics Central turns these guardrails into real-time developer guidance and AI safety insights‚Äîenabling the build of AI that is robust, secure, and aligned to firmwide governance from the ground up.

üí° Real-World Model Development Risk:
In 2022, researchers from Google and ETH Zurich uncovered that prompt injection vulnerabilities and training data poisoning were causing LLMs to hallucinate biased or malicious outputs even under normal use (source). By polluting training data with backdoored samples or manipulating instructions, attackers could silently hijack model behavior without triggering security alarms at deployment.

AI Ethics Central enables JPMorgan developers to prevent such attacks through:

Dataset lineage and validation workflows that trace the origin and integrity of training data

Pre-training prompt fuzzing tools to simulate adversarial inputs and detect insecure instruction handling

Token-level audit trails and injection filters that flag risky prompts or data before they ever hit model weights

This proactive detection of toxic prompts, poisoned samples, and instruction hijacking during development ensures that models never embed unsafe behaviors to begin with.

‚öôÔ∏è Platform Capabilities:
Pre-training Security Validation: Dataset poisoning scanners, prompt sanitization pipelines, adversarial prompt testing

Ethics-First Model Design: Bias/fairness analysis baked into CI/CD workflows

Benchmark Reference Models: Highlighting high-integrity models across lines of business as examples to emulate

Deploy-Time Risk Controls: Dynamic injection detection, restricted endpoints, access governance

Ongoing Monitoring Hooks: Drift detection, red team‚Äìinformed behavior flags, hallucination risk scoring

Audit and Explainability Reports: End-to-end traceability with automated reporting

Native Fusion Integration: Access controls, dashboards, and alerts through CDAO go/fusion

üß≠ AI Ethics Dimensions Covered:
Security & Poisoning Resilience: Blocking unsafe model behavior from seed stage

Fairness & Bias Mitigation: Dataset analysis and impact assessment

Transparency & Traceability: Data-to-deployment tracking

Privacy & Data Minimization: Controls against memorization or leakage

Misuse Prevention: Guardrails for prompt manipulation and instruction abuse

Sustainability: Promoting reuse of validated datasets and components

üí• Why It Matters:
With AI transforming risk assessments, financial decisioning, and customer interactions, an overlooked injection vector or poisoned training batch can compromise entire systems.

AI Ethics Central helps developers detect and neutralize such vulnerabilities long before production. It makes enterprise AI more resilient ‚Äî not just protected by guardrails, but built ethically by design.

‚úÖ Final Takeaway:
AI Ethics Central bridges the gap between ethical policy and engineering reality. It leverages existing firmwide controls and red teaming outcomes to guide developers earlier, foster reference-safe models, and make JPMorgan Chase a leader in secure, ethical, and future-ready AI.
