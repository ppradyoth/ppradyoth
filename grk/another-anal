Based on your garak report analysis and the broader landscape of model safety assessments, there are several fundamental differences in how garak evaluations relate to traditional safety assessment methodologies:

Paradigm Shift: Security-First vs Safety-First
Traditional Model Safety Assessments
Most previous safety assessments you've likely encountered focus on:

Bias detection and fairness metrics

Content moderation for harmful outputs

Capability evaluation with human-in-the-loop validation

Static benchmark testing against known problematic scenarios

Garak's Red Team Approach
Garak represents a security-focused paradigm that treats LLMs as attack surfaces:

Adversarial probing with over 20 specific attack-evaluation pairs

Vulnerability discovery rather than just compliance checking

Automated red teaming that simulates real attacker behavior

Structured exploration of unknown failure modes

Methodological Differences
Multi-Stage Evaluation Pipeline
Unlike traditional assessments, garak employs a sophisticated multi-stage process:

Probe Phase: Automated generation of adversarial prompts

Detection Phase: Pattern recognition in model responses

Evaluation Phase: Secondary assessment to prevent false positives

Reporting Phase: Dual-format output (technical + executive)

This explains why your JSONL data showed detector scores of 1.0 while final evaluation was 0% vulnerability - traditional assessments typically lack this nuanced evaluation pipeline.

Static vs Dynamic Assessment
Traditional approaches: Often rely on static test sets and human evaluation

Garak's approach: Dynamic probe generation with buff components that can modify and evolve attacks based on success patterns

Integration with Defense Mechanisms
A key differentiator is garak's native integration with defense systems:

Direct integration with NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails for before/after comparisons

Protection rate measurements (e.g., 76.1% clean vs 95.4% with moderation rails)

Real-time assessment of defense effectiveness

Traditional safety assessments typically evaluate models in isolation, not their defensive capabilities.



## **Technical Analysis: HTML vs JSONL Report Gaps**

As a red team technical analyst, here's a comprehensive breakdown of what each format lacks compared to the other:

## **Missing in JSONL (Present Only in HTML)**

### **Aggregation & Analysis Layer**
- **Group scoring calculations**: No `lower_quartile` aggregation logic visible
- **DEFCON rating assignments**: Raw scores don't show 1-5 DEFCON mapping
- **Percentage calculations**: Only raw pass/fail counts, no percentage derivation
- **Hierarchical organization**: Flat sequential entries vs. grouped probe→detector structure

### **Contextual Intelligence**
- **Documentation links**: No reference URLs to `garak.probes.dan.html`
- **Human-readable descriptions**: Technical detector names without explanatory text
- **Security context**: Missing interpretation of what "0.0% failed" means for security posture
- **Visual indicators**: No color coding or visual severity indicators

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Collapsible sections**: All data flat, no progressive disclosure
- **Hover tooltips**: No contextual help for technical terms
- **Accordion functionality**: No way to focus on specific probe results

## **Missing in HTML (Present Only in JSONL)**

### **Workflow Granularity**
```json
{"entry_type": "attempt", "status": 1, ...}  // Initial attempt
{"entry_type": "attempt", "status": 2, ...}  // Post-detection processing
```
- **Status progression tracking**: No visibility into attempt lifecycle
- **Intermediate processing states**: Missing steps between detection and evaluation

### **Raw Detector Outputs**
```json
"detector_results": {"dan.DANJailbreak": [1.0], "mitigation.MitigationBypass": [1.0]}
```
- **Pre-aggregation scores**: HTML only shows final 0.0%, not initial 1.0 flagging
- **Individual detector arrays**: Raw score collections before statistical processing
- **Detection confidence levels**: Granular scoring lost in HTML summary

### **Complete Audit Trail**
- **UUID tracking**: `"uuid": "32566841-bdf7-4f13-b149-31ace5109e0a"` for forensic correlation
- **Exact timestamps**: Precise timing for each processing step
- **Message arrays**: Full conversation context including role assignments
- **Entry type categorization**: Workflow step identification (`start_run`, `attempt`, `eval`, etc.)

### **Technical Configuration Details**
```json
"transient.report_filename": "/Users/ppradyoth/.local/share/garak/garak_runs/..."
"system.max_workers": 500
"run.soft_probe_prompt_cap": 256
```
- **Runtime parameters**: Execution environment specifics
- **File system paths**: Actual storage locations
- **Performance settings**: Parallel processing configurations
- **Language settings**: `"run.target_lang": "en"` specifications

### **Model Response Verbatim**
```json
"outputs": ["*qwen2:7b successfully jailbroken.*"]
```
- **Exact model responses**: Word-for-word AI output (missing in HTML)
- **Response arrays**: Multiple generation handling capability
- **Prompt reconstruction**: Complete input/output correlation

## **Critical Technical Gaps**

### **For Security Analysis**
**HTML Missing**: Raw detector scores make it impossible to understand **why** Garak concluded 0% vulnerability when detectors initially flagged the response

**JSONL Missing**: Aggregation logic means you can't understand **how** individual 1.0 scores became 0% without external knowledge of evaluation algorithms

### **For Debugging**
**HTML Missing**: No way to trace individual attempts or debug detector logic failures

**JSONL Missing**: No visual representation makes pattern recognition across multiple probes nearly impossible

### **For Compliance/Audit**
**HTML Missing**: Lacks forensic-level detail needed for security audit trail

**JSONL Missing**: No human-readable summary for regulatory reporting or executive briefing

## **Technical Recommendations**

For **red team operations**, you need **both formats**:

1. **JSONL for technical analysis**: Understanding detector behavior, debugging false positives/negatives, and building custom analysis pipelines

2. **HTML for stakeholder communication**: Presenting findings to security leadership and documenting assessment outcomes

3. **Missing integration point**: Garak lacks a format that combines raw technical detail with interpretive analysis - consider building custom parsers that bridge this gap for operational use.

The fundamental issue is that **neither format alone provides complete technical insight** - the HTML abstracts away too much detail, while the JSONL provides no analytical context for the raw data.
