🔍 Definition
Security Inference Testing (SIT) is the practice of evaluating AI systems during inference to uncover potential security vulnerabilities, misbehaviors, or policy violations.

🎯 Purpose of SIT

Assess how AI models respond to adversarial, misleading, or risky inputs

Identify weaknesses in input handling, content generation, and safety controls

Ensure models behave securely, ethically, and compliantly under real-world usage

⚠️ Why It Matters

AI systems are exposed to unpredictable and untrusted user inputs

Threats like prompt injection, data leakage, and toxic responses are increasing

Helps organizations proactively harden AI models before deployment

🧠 Think of SIT as stress-testing your AI — but from a security perspective.
It’s a crucial step in building trustworthy and responsible AI systems.
